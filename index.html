    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      A <b>Digital Media</b> student with a passion for programming whose joy is
      coming up with projects to experiment new techniques. My background in
      <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> allowed me to develop strong analytical
      thinking and my experiences as a <b>Physics Tutor</b> and Coffee Barista
      helped improve communication skills.

        I modeled and coded the WINNING bot of a 32-team tournament. The bot
        used sensors to recognize the arena's boundaries as well as the
        opponent, and was able to make calculated decisions to win the brawl.
